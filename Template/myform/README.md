    This computer-adaptive assessment was developed by Dr. Chris Gibbons at the University of Cambridge Psychometrics Centre. It uses items from the WHOQOL-100 measure of physical, psychological, social and environmental quality of life.
</p>

<p>
    You will asked a series of questions about different aspects of your life. The assesment takes under 10 minutes to answer, there are no right or wrong answers and you will be provided with your results at the end. In order to get the most value from this assessment, you should answer all of the questions as honestly as possible, and with reference to how you see yourself at the moment, not as you would like to be in future. Your instinctive response to a question is usually the best one.
</p>

    We hope you enjoy this assessment and gain new insight on your quality of life.
